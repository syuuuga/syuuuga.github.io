I am a highly responsible individual. During my university years, I served as the class monitor for F2003302 and as the assistant for the F2102134 class. To utilize my skills in helping classmates, I joined the operations management department of the Makers Club, where I served as an assistant manager for the 3D printing center for four years. Additionally, to convey students' opinions and suggestions, I served as a student representative for the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering. Moreover, to contribute to society, I joined the iSee Social Practice Training Camp in 2021 and volunteered for the Shanghai Marathon.

<br>I lead a diverse life. I have a keen interest in language learning and, apart from studying English, I self-studied Japanese and obtained the N2 certificate. Furthermore, I have had a passion for music and painting since childhood and obtained a Level 9 certificate in violin during primary school.

<br>Due to my interest in anime and movies, I ventured into computer vision during my university years. I also learned webpage design and video editing, sparking my interest in visual effects in film and television.
