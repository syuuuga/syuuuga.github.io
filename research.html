<br>1. Recognized as an innovation project of the "National Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program" of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2023. 
<br>2. Awarded the Extraordinary Prize in the 5th Shanghai Jiao Tong University - Weining Health Smart Medical Challenge (First Place in the University Group) in 2023.<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Real-time diagnostic system for large-scale pathological images:</b>
<br>The real-time diagnostic system employs the RandStainNA model and ResNet18 network for large-scale pathological images. Experiments are conducted on a nine-class colorectal cancer dataset, with results visualized. Pathological images are inputted in the top-left corner, and upon processing, classification results for each block are annotated with colors. A pie chart in the bottom-left corner shows real-time quantities and proportions of each classification. In the central area, zoomed-in results, confidence probabilities, and distributions of image blocks into specific categories are displayed in real-time.
<br>The system utilizes various visualization tools to dynamically showcase the neural network processing progress, assisting clinicians in clinical diagnosis.

<br><b>High-Throughput Thyroid Rapid Diagnostic System:</b>
<br>In the overall design: We adopt a structured approach, decomposing the software system into two functional modules: the nucleus segmentation module and the thyroid grading prediction module. The organizational structure of the system is described through various types of visualization charts.
<br>In the nucleus segmentation module: Upon selecting a thyroid pathological image, we identify regions of viable cells amidst blank areas. Clicking the cell segmentation button initiates nucleus segmentation, where different-colored blocks represent nuclei. Specific information is displayed, and this process is repeated for each region, resulting in a heatmap of cell density for the entire image. Neural network analysis is then focused on high-density regions.

<br>In the thyroid grading prediction module: Clicking the processing button enables users to freely drag and zoom the predicted thyroid grades. The bottom-left corner displays cell counts for each classification, ranging from grades 1 to 6, with grade 6 indicating thyroid cancer prediction. Clicking different positions in the image allows viewing of the original image magnified 20 times on the right, with corresponding grade probabilities shown.

<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Wide-angle OCTA Image Classification and Lesion Area Segmentation: </b>
<br>This project employed color jittering for image enhancement and utilized the UNet++ neural network for lesion segmentation in wide-angle OCTA images. Comparative experiments involved training networks with UNet and UNet++, using Jaccard and Dice as loss functions, and implementing various learning rate adjustment strategies. Through systematic evaluation, an optimal configuration was determined based on experimental evidence for network and loss function selection, resulting in effective image segmentation.

<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Real-Time Ray Tracing:</b>
<br>Our main goal is real-time ray tracing and denoising frames with noise. We progressively denoise a ray-traced animation through three steps: joint bilateral filtering for individual frame denoising, motion vector computation for inter-frame information, and temporal accumulation of inter-frame data for further denoising. Additionally, we implemented an optional a-trous wavelet algorithm for accelerated single-frame denoising. Ultimately, we achieve real-time denoising for a ray-traced animation.
