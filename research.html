<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>大型病理图像实时诊断系统:利用实验室开发的RandStainNA模型与ResNet18网络，在结直肠癌九分类数据集上进行分类实验，并将实验的结果可视化。可以实时显示各个分类的数量及比例，并可在中心区域实时查看小图像块的放大结果、该分类的置信概率，以及被划分为某一特定分类的图像块分布。该系统利用各种可视化图表工具实时展示神经网络处理进程，协助医生临床诊断。高通量甲状腺快速诊断系统:整体的设计采用结构化的设计方法，将软件系统分解成两个功能模块，分别为细胞核分割模块和甲状腺分级预测模块，并通过各类可视化图表来描述系统的组织结构。在细胞核分割模块，选择一张甲状腺病理图像，单独对每一个小patch进行细胞核分割处理，使用不同颜色的小块代表不同的细胞核，同时显示核分割的具体信息。最终得到整张病理图像所对应的细胞密度热力图。在甲状腺分级预测模块，根据细胞密度热力图，我们只需要针对细胞密度高的区域进行神经网络分析。根据TBSRTC分级标准对细胞进行分类，分级从1到6级严重程度递增，6级可预测为甲状腺癌。同时显示每个分类所对应的细胞的数量，并且可以查看任意patch放大20倍后的原始图像以及该patch被划分成1到6级分别对应的可能性。</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>We study how capital controls and domestic macroprudential policy tame credit supply booms, either directly or by enhancing the local bank-lending channel of monetary policy. We exploit credit registry data and the introduction of capital controls on foreign exchange (FX) debt inflows and increase of reserve requirements on domestic bank deposits in Colombia during a boom. We find that capital controls strengthen the bank-lending channel. Increasing the local monetary policy rate widens the interest rate differential with the U.S.; hence, relatively more FX-indebted banks carry-trade cheap FX-funds with expensive peso lending, especially towards riskier firms. Capital controls tax FX-debt and break the carry-trade. Differently, raising reserve requirements on domestic deposits directly reduces credit supply, particularly for riskier firms, rather than enhancing the bank-lending channel. Importantly, banks differentially finance credit with domestic vis-à-vis FX-financing; hence, capital controls and domestic macroprudential policy complementarily mitigate the credit boom and related bank risk-taking.</p>

<strong><a href="https://rdcu.be/b53FH">Breaking the Word Bank: Measurement and Effects of Bank Level Uncertainty</a></strong><br><u><i>Journal of Financial Services Research</i></u>, 59, 1-45, 2021<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Banks differ from non-financial firms as they must communicate to both regulators and shareholders. Also, unlike non-financial firms, banks possess opaque and complex balance sheets and are the main providers of credit to the real economy. In this paper, I propose a new index to detect the idiosyncratic uncertainty banks face at the bank-quarter level by applying natural language processing techniques to earnings conference call transcripts. The index reveals which banks at a given quarter signal more uncertainty about their balance sheets. Higher uncertainty is associated with lower lending the next quarter and higher liquidity, suggesting active management of uncertainty. The active management of uncertainty is more pronounced during periods of high aggregate volatility and for banks with more skin-in-the-game. Using loan-level data and firm-fixed effects, I control for demand-side factors and find higher bank-level uncertainty is associated with lower loan issuances the following quarter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Non-US firms have massively borrowed dollars (foreign currency, FX), leading to booms and crises. We show the real effects of capital controls, including benefits, through a firm-debt mechanism. For identification, we exploit a tax on FX-debt inflows in Colombia before the global financial crisis (GFC), and administrative, proprietary datasets, including credit register data and FX-debt inflows. Capital controls substantially reduce FX-debt inflows (larger for more-exposed-FX firms). Moreover, firms with weaker local banking relationships cannot substitute FX-debt with domestic-debt, thereby reducing imports. However, capital controls improve exports during the GFC –by preemptively reducing pre-crisis firm-level debt–, especially for financially-constrained firms.</p><br>
